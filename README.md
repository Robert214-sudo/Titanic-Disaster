# Titanic-Disaster
This project is a predictive modeling exercise based on the classic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset provided by Kaggle. The goal is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, sex, class, and fare.
